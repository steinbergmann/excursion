        We’re leaving you to complete this web page on your own, we trust you can do it. Here are some notes to help make it the best you can:

The white “Cellphone icon” image linked above will appear blank against the white background. We promise it’s there!

Make new directories inside the resources directory called images and videos to store these items.

Since your images, videos, and stylesheets are all in the resources directory, you’ll need to include that in the path when you link to them. For example, the path to your stylesheet will be resources/css/style.css.

By default, images will appear on the same line as the element before them. In the mock, all our images are centered on their own line. To effect this, make a new paragraph element and put the image element inside of it.
